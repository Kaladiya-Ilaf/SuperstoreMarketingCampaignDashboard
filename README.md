I started by obtaining the "Superstore marketing campaign" dataset from Kaggle.  Using Google Colab, I then performed data cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare the data for further analysis. This preprocessed data was subsequently saved, and I utilized it to create the following interactive dashboard.

The file named "superstore_data" contains the raw dataset I downloaded from Kaggle. This raw data has undergone cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare it for analysis. The resulting preprocessed data is stored in the file named "superstorecampaign_data".
